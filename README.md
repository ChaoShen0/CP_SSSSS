<h3>Tested only in Unity 5.4.2, works with deferred/forward, gamma/linear, HDR/LDR, DX11/DX9.</h3>
<h3>Scene view previewing and previewing in edit mode are disabled until i figure out a better way to deal with materials and per-object properties.</h3>

<h1>How to use:</h1>
<ol>
<li>Put the files into any folder in your .../Assets/Resources folder</li>
<li>Attach the CP_SSSSS_Main script to your main camera</li>
<li>Attach CP_SSSSS_Object script to any Renderer object that you want to have subsurface scattering on</li>
<li>Start the game to see the effect in action</li>
</ol>

<h1>Basic idea behind algorithm:</h1>
<ol>
<li>Blur the source image separably, based on the distance from the camera, and attenuate surrounding sample's influence based on the depth difference between this sample and the center sample (Soft Depth Bias parameter controls the maximum dpeth difference allowed)</li>
<li>Render the scene with replaced shader, using the mask set in CP_SSSSS_Object script multiplied by the subsurface color</li>
<li>Composite the blurred stuff, multiplying it by mask from step 2, and substracting the original based on the Affect Direct parameter<li>
</ol>
